# Github web-hook

A configurable Github Web hook server in NodeJS

Note: This one is still in the works. Currently Uses GithubWebHook, a standalone package
that needs an independent internet facing endpoint. I might turn it around into an Express
middleware that you can pull into your own Express projects (that's what I need it for
eventually).
